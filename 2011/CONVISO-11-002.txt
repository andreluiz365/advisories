[CONVISO-11-002] - Related Posts Word Press Plugin Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability

1. Advisory Information
    Conviso Advisory ID: CONVISO-11-002
    CVE ID: CVE-2011-0760
    CVSS v2: 6.7, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N)
    Date: 2011-03-24

2. Affected Components
    WP Related Posts 1.0

3. Description
    The WordPress Related Posts Plugin, available at http://WordPress.org/extend/plugins/wp-related-
    posts/ shows the posts related to others posts. This advisory describes multiple Stored Cross
    Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and one Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability on
    the plugin.
    As a result, an attacker can gain elevated access privileges to sensitive page content, session
    cookies, and a variety of other information maintained by the web browser on behalf of the
    WordPress administrator. Furthermore, the attacker can perform actions with administrative
    privileges.

4. Details
    The plugin's configuration page is vulnerable to Stored Cross Site Scripting. The three fields
    wp_relatedposts_ title, wp_relatedposts_num and wp_relatedposts_type are received through POST
    or GET and included on the response page with inadequate sanitization. The vulnerable code is
    shown bellow:

    158: <tr valign="top">
    159:        <th scope="row">Title:</th>
    160:                        <td><input type="text" name="wp_relatedposts_title"
    value="<?=$options['title']?>"></td>
    161: </tr>
    162: <tr valign="top">
    163:        <th scope="row">Number posts:</th>
    164:                        <td><input type="text" name="wp_relatedposts_num"
    value="<?=$options['count']?>"></td>
    165: </tr>
    166: <tr valign="top">
    167:        <th scope="row">Related on:</th>
    168:                        <td>
    169:                                        <select name="wp_relatedposts_type">
    170:                                                        <option selected
    value="<?=$options['type']?>"><?=$options['type']?></option>
    171:                                                        <option value="Tags">Tags</option>
    172:                                                        <option
    value="Category">Category</option>
    173:                                                        </select>
    174:                        </td>

    Another vulnerable piece of code is the one which prints the related posts list. The title,
    eceived through the parameter wp_relatedposts_title, is included with little sanitization into
    suchs lists. The vulnerable code is shown bellow:

    79: $relatedpost.= '<br><br><br><h3>' . $options['title'] . '</h3><ul>';

    (...)

    120: $relatedpost.= '<br><br><br><h3>' . $options['title'] . '</h3><ul>';

    These vulnerabilities allow an attacker to insert HTML/JavaScript commands to be interpreted in
    the session of an authenticated administrator. Since the plugin's configuration page is not
    protected against Cross Site Request Forgery, the exploitation permits the attacker to inject
    configuration values. Proof of concept exploitation code is available to interested parties.

5. Solution
    The developers have not provided a patch or workaround. The solution should add code to sanitize
    the values before including them using the htmlspecialchars() function or equivalent.
    Furthermore, a mechanism to protect against the CSRF is needed to prevent an attacker from
    changing the pluginâ€™s configuration.
