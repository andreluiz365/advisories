[CONVISO-11-001] - Recaptcha Word Press Plugin Cross Site Scripting Vulnerability

1. Advisory Information
    Conviso Advisory ID: CONVISO-11-001
    CVE ID: CVE-2011-0759
    CVSS v2: 6.7, (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:N)
    Date: 2011-03-24

2. Affected Components
    WP-reCAPTCHA 2.9.8.2

3. Description
    The WordPress Recaptcha Plugin integrates reCAPTCHA antispam methods with WordPress including
    comment, registration, and email spam protection and is available at [1]. This advisory
    describes multiple Stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities and one Cross Site Request
    Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability on the plugin.  As a result, an attacker can gain elevated access
    privileges to sensitive page content, session cookies, and a variety of other information
    maintained by the browser on behalf of the WordPress administrator user. Furthermore, the
    attacker can perform actions administrative privileges.


4. Details
    The plugin's configuration page is vulnerable to Stored Cross Site Scripting. Several fields are
    received through POST and included on the response page with inadequate sanitization. The
    vulnerable code is shown bellow:

    749: <input name="recaptcha_opt_pubkey" id="recaptcha_opt_pubkey" size="40"

    value="<?php echo $optionarray_def['pubkey']; ?>" />

    753: <input name="recaptcha_opt_privkey" id="recaptcha_opt_privkey" size="40"

    value="<?php echo $optionarray_def['privkey']; ?>" />

    782: <input name="re_tabindex" id="re_tabindex" size="5" value="<?php echo

    $optionarray_def['re_tabindex']; ?>" />

    814: <input name="error_blank" id="error_blank" size="80" value="<?php

    echo $optionarray_

    def['error_blank']; ?>" />

    818: <input name="error_incorrect" id="error_incorrect" size="80" value="<?php

    echo $optionarray_def['error_incorrect']; ?>" />

    865: <input name="mailhide_pub" id="mailhide_pub" size="40" value="<?php echo

    $optionarray_def['mailhide_pub']; ?>" />

    869: <input name="mailhide_priv" id="mailhide_priv" size="40" value="<?php echo

    $optionarray_def['mailhide_priv']; ?>" />

    888: <input name="mh_replace_link" id="mh_replace_link" size="40" value="<?php

    echo $optionarray_def['mh_replace_link']; ?>" />

    891: <input name="mh_replace_title" id="mh_replace_title" size="40" value="<?php

    echo $optionarray_def['mh_replace_title']; ?>" />

    As a result, an attacker may insert HTML/JavaScript commands to be interpreted in the session of
    an authenticated administrator and, as the plugin's configuration page is not protected against
    Cross Site Request Forgery, the exploitation can be used to inject configuration values and
    change the reCAPTCHA configuration, disabling CAPTCHA for comments and registration forms. Proof
    of concept exploitation code is available to interested parties.

5. Solution
    The developer did not provided a patch or workaround. The solution for this issue should add
    code to sanitize the values before including them using the htmlspecialchars() function or
    equivalent. Furthermore, a mechanism to protect against the CSRF is needed to prevent an
    attacker from changing the pluginâ€™s configuration.
