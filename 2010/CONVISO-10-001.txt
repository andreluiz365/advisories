[CONVISO-10-001] - 24/7 Real Media's Open AdStream v.5.7 Incorrect Default Permission

1. Advisory Information
    Conviso Advisory ID: CONVISO-10-001
    CVE ID: CVE-2010-1582
    CVSS v2: 9
    Date: 2010-01-14

2. Affected Components
    The vulnerability was identified on the deployment of Open AdStream Version 5.7. This version of
    the product can be used only with MySQL 3.23 and Apache 1.36.x.

3. Description
    This advisory describes a vulnerability in the permission of the directory RealMedia created as
    default during the installation of Open AdStream, an ad campaign management platform provided by
    24/7 Real Media, which exposes directly to the Internet the configuration files, including .sql
    which contains access credentials. As a result, a cracker can use this flaw to install a
    backdoor or take the ownership of the affected component as he/she had access to all
    configuration files and access credentials.

4. Details
    The deployment process performed by 24/7 Real Media keeps the default configuration on Open
    AdStream which publishes the configuration files of the host exposed to the Internet on a format
    such as http://admXX.customername.com.br/RealMedia. As a result the following example files can
    be fully accessed:

    oasis_wsusr_nightly.cronoasis_mysql_createdb.sql
    oasis_wsusr_nightly.cron.templateoasis_mysql_createdb.sql.template

    The database server location as well as access credentials of administrative accounts can be
    found within the files oasis_mysql_insertuser.sql and oasis_params.cfg. With this information,
    an attacker could gain access to the database and perform any malicious activity. Other files
    such as oasis_install.ini and install.sh discloses the directory organization of Open AdStream
    server, which could be useful in combination with another attack.

    Other problem we found is related to the old versions of Apache HTTP server and MySQL that must
    be installed to use the affected software.

5. Solution
    The permission of the directory RealMedia should be changed in order to deny access to the
    configuration files.
